# Site Description

Site Description - this should be about a one paragraph description of the site describing its location, size, major habitats, or other descriptive information about the site.  General species info can be placed here (e.g. *"The wetlands at this site provide high quality habitat for a number of species of dragonflies."*).  
<br><br><br><br>
Paragraphs can be added to supply more detail about each species or group of species at this NHA, if you want. If information is added, try to keep it general and not have a lot of detail about each specific taxon as it will help to keep the sites as current as possible without a lot of ongoing editing-remember, we are going to rely on the factsheets for that purpose.  For example, it would be good to say something like "The dragonflies at this site depend on clean water to breed" as that statement would likely be true even if we added or subtracted species to the list.

This brief description from the NHA geodatabase reads: **`r selected_nha[7]$BRIEF_DESC`**

Please check the species table below for accuracy. Make a note of any issues, using Word comments.

```{r species table, echo=FALSE}

SD_speciesTablePrint <- SD_speciesTable[,-c(1:2)]
row.names(SD_speciesTablePrint) <- SD_speciesTable$SNAME

#Print species table for site

## Information from Biotics

See output below from Biotics, in association with all the EOs at this site. Biotics fields reported include `r names(ptreps_selected)`. Use this to inform both the site description and the threats and conservation recommendations section.  
To learn more about each EO, follow the links provided below to the Biotics page for each EO at this site:  

`r Links`  

<br><br><br><br>

```{r print Biotics info, echo=FALSE}

SD_eodata <- ptreps_selected
SD_eodatap <- c(SD_eodata, sep="--")
do.call(paste, SD_eodatap)

```

# Threats and Conservation Recommendations

This area should include, first, a short, one paragraph description of the overall threats and conservation recommendations for the NHA. This paragraph could include an overview of historic impacts, a general statement about the level of site protection, existing management plans, and known conservation issues. Incorporate information specific to the site overall, as well as to the individual EO's present.

<br><br><br><br>

**Enter your threats and conservation recommendations summary paragraph in the space between these lines:**

***  
|THRRECP_B|  

*enter text here, between these tags. Please do not delete the tags!!*
  
|THRRECP_E|   

***  

<br><br><br><br>

Secondly, this section will contain a bulleted list of known conservation issues at this site, and what needs to be done to address them. Use the pre-generated EO-associated conservation threats and recommendations available below as a starting point. Be as specific as you possibly can--for example, if an EO is generally known to be susceptible to invasive species and there is information in Biotics about particular invasive species known to be present at this site, incorporate the specific information into the pre-written invasive species bullet. For example:  

* *Aggressive non-native plant species are a particular threat to species is calcareous habitats. Invasive species known to be present at this site include xxxx, xxxx, xxxx, and xxxx. Monitor for invasive plant species and remove them prior to becoming dominant at this site, if possible. Target pioneer populations of invasive plants for immediate and continued removal.*

**Enter your specific threats and conservation recommendations bullets in the space between these lines:**

## EO-Specific Threats and Conservation Recommendation Info

Included below is species-specific information on general conservation threats and recommendations. This includes:  
<br><br><br><br>

1.  A summary table with the number of EOs that fall into each of the conservation threats/recommendations categories at the site. This table is meant to help you quickly summarize the types of issues that the species present at this site face, for the threats and conservation recommendations summary paragraph.   

2. The text for each species-specific threat and recommendation available in the database. Copy and paste those which are relevant at this site into conservation threats and recommendations bullets.


``` {r EO Threats Database, echo=FALSE}

#join tables and report threats and recs for selected species
Sel_TR <- inner_join(ELCODE_sub, TRtable, copy=TRUE) %>%
  select(SNAME, ThreatRec_Name, Threats, Recs, Citation_Full) %>% collect()
  
#summarize by category of threats/recs and number of species present at site which they apply to

Cat_Count <- Sel_TR %>% add_count(ThreatRec_Name) %>% select(ThreatRec_Name, n)
ThreatCatTable <- flextable(head(Cat_Count))
ThreatCatTable <- autofit(ThreatCatTable)
ThreatCatTable

do.call(paste, Sel_TR)

```
